## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p class="text-spacing1"><span class="number">10k+</span>COMPANIES</p>
```
```css
.row {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    margin: auto;
}
```
### Continued development

I'm still not completely comfortable with positioning, flexbox and grid techniques.
